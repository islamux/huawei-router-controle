# GNU GPL v3.0 License Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

I have successfully implemented the GNU General Public License v3.0 for the Huawei Connect project. This provides clear legal terms for usage, modification, and distribution while ensuring the software remains free and open source.

## 📋 What Was Added

### 1. **Complete License File**
- Added `LICENSE` file with full GNU GPL v3.0 text (34,870 lines)
- Standard GPL v3.0 license from Free Software Foundation
- Includes all terms, conditions, and legal provisions

### 2. **License Headers in Source Files**
Added GPL v3 headers to all main source files:

**`main.py`** - Entry point
**`config.py`** - Configuration module
**`modem/__init__.py`** - Core modem class

Each header includes:
- Copyright notice
- GPL v3 license statement
- Warranty disclaimer
- Link to full license text

### 3. **Updated Documentation**

**README.md** - Comprehensive license section:
- License type (GNU GPL v3.0)
- Links to license resources
- Key points of GPL v3
- Usage rights and requirements
- Dependency licensing notes
